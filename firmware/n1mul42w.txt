DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED


 [Checking on ThinkPad Setup]

  1. Turn on the computer.
  2. While the "To interrupt normal startup, press Enter" message is displayed
     at the lower-left area or lower-center of the screen, press the F1 key.
     The ThinkPad Setup menu will be displayed. If a password prompt appears,
     type the correct password.
  3. Locate the UEFI BIOS Version line.
     "UEFI BIOS version (BIOS ID)" will be shown on the UEFI BIOS Version line.
  4. Turn off the computer.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

- If the UEFI BIOS has been rolled back to version 1.29 from higher version,
  CPU microcode (MCU) is also rolled back to older version than the one addressed
  for CVE-2017-5715.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.23 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.23 for security improvement.

- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.14 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.14 for security improvement.

- Be aware that ThinkPad Dock have the latest Dock firmware by applying
  the Dock firmware update tool available at the Lenovo site.

- Be aware that the OS Optimized Defaults option in the Restart menu of ThinkPad
  Setup should not be normally changed. Lenovo recommends to use the factory
  default setting for it, as follows.

UPDATING THE UEFI BIOS

Note for Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS:
  See "Manual Update Using fwupdmgr" section for instruction.

IMPORTANT NOTE for Debian 9.3.0:
  Debian 9.3.0 does not include fwupd package which is required to update
  firmware by default.
  Please check with your distribution vendor contact how to install
  fwupd package. After you installed fwupd package,
  see "Manual Update Using fwupdmgr" section for instruction.

IMPORTANT NOTE for Red Hat Linux Enterprise 7.5:
  Red Hat Linux Enterprise 7.5 does not include fwupd package
  which is required to update firmware by default.
  Please check with your distribution vendor contact how to install
  fwupd package. After you installed fwupd package,
  see "Manual Update Using fwupdmgr" section for instruction.

IMPORTANT NOTE for Suse Linux Enterprise 12 SP3:
  No fwupd package is available for Suse Linux Enterprise 12 SP3.
  You need to use "fwupdate" command instead, a lower-layer frontend,
  which is not included by default.
  Please check with your distribution vendor contact how to install
  fwupdate package. See "Manual Update Using fwupdate" section.


Notes:
- If the UEFI BIOS has been rolled back to version 1.29 from higher version,
  CPU microcode (MCU) is also rolled back to older version than the one addressed
  for CVE-2017-5715.
- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.23 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.23 for security improvement.
- If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 1.14 or higher, it is no longer
  able to roll back to the version before 1.14 for security improvement.
- If your computer runs satisfactorily now, it may not be necessary to update
  the UEFI BIOS. To determine if you should update the UEFI BIOS, refer to the
  Version Information section.
- You need an AC adapter and a charged battery pack.
- Remove the Power-on password prior to updating the UEFI BIOS in the remote
  deployment environments.

Attention:
  Do not turn off or suspend the computer until the update has been completed.
  IF YOU DO THAT WHILE THE UPDATE IS STILL IN PROGRESS, THE SYSTEM BOARD MAY
  HAVE TO BE REPLACED.


Manual Update Using fwupdmgr

  1. Make sure the AC adapter is firmly connected to the target computer.
  2. Launch Terminal.
  3. Move to the directory where the cabinet file was placed.
  4. Run fwupdmgr to schedule firmware update.

        # fwupdmgr install xxx.cab

  5. Restart the system.
     You may be able to use "reboot" command.
     If it is not available, select "Reboot" from Power icon on the desktop.
  6. The computer will be restarted and the EFI BIOS will be updated.


Manual Update Using fwupdate

  Superuser privilege is required during the instruction.

  1. Make sure the AC adapter is firmly connected to the target computer.
  2. Launch Files application on GNOME desktop.
  3. Locate the directory where the cabinet file was placed.
  4. Right-click the cabinet file, select Extract Here.
  5. Launch Terminal.
  6. Move to the directory where the contents of the cabinet file was extracted.
  7. Check GUID of System Firmware

        # su
        # fwupdate -l

     "fwupdate -l" lists GUIDs as follows.
     Check a GUID which is marked as System Firmware type.

        System Firmware Type, {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx} version XXX can be updated to any version above XXX
        Device Firmware Type, {yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy} version YYY can be updated to any version above YYY
        Device Firmware Type, {zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz} version ZZZ can be updated to any version above ZZZ

  8. Run fwupdate with the GUID obtained in the Step.7.
     If fwupdate succeeds to schedule firmware update, it finishes silently without any message.

        # su
        # fwupdate -a xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx firmware.bin

  9. Restart the system.
     You may be able to use "reboot" command.
     If it is not available, select "Reboot" from Power icon on the desktop.
 10. The computer will be restarted and the EFI BIOS will be updated.
 11. Finally delete the files extracted in the Step.4.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  2. While the "To interrupt normal startup, press Enter" message is displayed
     at the lower-left area or lower-center area of the screen, press the F1 key.
     The ThinkPad Setup menu will be displayed. If a password prompt appears,
     type the correct password.
  3. Press the F9 key to load default configuration.
  4. Select Yes.
